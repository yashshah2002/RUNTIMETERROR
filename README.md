  *****     ABOUT OUR PROJECT ****
                
  During the COVID-19 pandemic there were many problems that we have faced whether it be the burst of corona cases or the lack of medical equipment for the treatment of COVID-19. But there was one other major problem except this virus which is confusion. According to the information available we can say that the symptoms of this virus are very similar to viral fever and flu, therefore confusing people what dieses they have. This eventually results in improper care and sometime even results in the death of patience. Well not anymore, what we are going to do is make a dieses prediction model which in return of few simple questions will give an accurate answer about what kind of dieses you have and what are required precaution one need to take

  *******       HOW DOES IT WORK  ******
           
  It is very simple. You will get all the information of the disease you have along with the precaution and treatment information. All you have to do is answer few simple questions related to your symptoms and you will get what you want. But how accurate our results are you must wonder. Don't worry in all the test we have performed we an average of 92% accurate results so don't worry unless you are the unluckiest person on this planet ðŸ˜….
